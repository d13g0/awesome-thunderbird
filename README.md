# awesome-thunderbird

After 10 years of frustration with Apple Mail. I am switching back to Thunderbird. Here are some customizations



## userChrome.css

Add this file to your Thunderbird chrome folder. For mac users this folder will be located at:

`~/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles/<<profile-folder>>/chrome`

What is contained in this file:

* Configurable font size for the interface
* Using SF Pro by default (Mac) instead of Verdana
* mail list with alternating colors (I am old fashioned like that, when TB was awesome)
* message header buttons without borders (more streamlined imo)  
* warning messages appear in a toned-down blue (instead of the very bright yellow ugh!)

Also:

I am working on using CSS variables with the goal of easing updating / creating different styles.

Next in my list:

* Dark mode
